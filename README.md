# MovieTickets
# Introduction
- Built a movie tickets mobile app using Java. This app enables a user to view a list of currently playing movies and purchase tickets. This app shows a list of movies with an image, title, release date, summary, rate, and a buy ticket button. When the user clicks on the button, saves the purchase in the Room database and shows the movie information on the My Tickets screen.
- This app practiced the knowledge of Recycler View, fetching data from API using Retrofit, Bottom Navigation View, navigation between screens using Fragments, saving and loading data from Room database, and displaying images using Glide.
